I am pleased to announce, based on the NOAA Research Personnel
Management Advisory Committee (PMAC) recommendation, the FY 2001 NOAA
Research Employees of the Year.  The PMAC selected seven recipients.
Each of them will receive a plaque and a $2,500 cash award.    Please
join me in extending congratulations to our FY 2001 NOAA Research
Employees of the Year:

Lt. Joel Michalski, CMDL - for unprecedented improvements at the Samoa
Observatory, raising recognition and appreciation for NOAA within the
community through an effective outreach program, and ensuring that the
data quality and reliability of onsite instruments is  better than it
has ever been in the 30 year history of the Samoa Observatory.

Thomas E. Ayers, ETL - for playing a critical role in constructing,
testing, improving, and deploying five millimeter cloud radars used at
several international sites.  Because of the importance of this radar as
a new atmospheric sensor, it has been commercialized through a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between ETL and
Radian.

Evan B. Forde, AOML - For his early initiatives and sustained commitment
to outreach for NOAA and in science education in his community and in
classrooms around the nation.  Because of his commitment to outreach
activities, the children of Miami-Dade County are aware that interesting
careers in oceanography and meteorology are open to them.

Robert Roddy, AOML - for working tirelessly to support the field
operations of the Physical Oceanography Division of AOML.  He has spent
extensive time at sea, far more than required by his position and has
worked long hours under very demanding conditions.   Without his
dedication and participation the projects would have been seriously
jeopardized.

Steve Hankin, PMEL - for his development and leadership of the Ferret
scientific analysis and visualization software over the past 10 years.
Ferret is a flexible tool in which the user can probe and compare large
and complex data sets and produce excellent publication-quality graphics
widely used by thousands of scientists in NOAA and around the world.

Michael Trainer, AL - for conducting research that, in one fell swoop,
solved an atmospheric chemistry mystery, broadened the horizons of our
perspective on the linkages of local/regional/global scales in the lower
atmosphere, and launched new activities in research groups within and
outside of the US.

Martin Hoerling, CDC - for his work on  the advancement of understanding
our seasonal climate predictability, the advancement progress on NOAA's
seasonal-to-internannual climate prediction effort, and the advancement
of understanding on the dynamics of climate change.

NOAA Research will host an Employee of the Year Award ceremony and
reception at 3:00 pm on October 11, 2001, at NOAA Research Headquarters
in Silver Spring, Maryland.  The award ceremony will be held in the NOAA
Science Center (next door to SSMC-4) followed by a reception.  This
event is open to all NOAA Research employees.  I encourage you to attend
and support this years' winners.

Congratulations to all individuals who were nominated and a special
&quot;Thank You&quot; to all who participated in the nomination process.
