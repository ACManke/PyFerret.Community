<pre>Adding (or replacing) the text with a program like Adobe Illustrator can improve the plots tremendously. For important plots, I typically create them as postscript in Ferret and then touch-up the text, move around the color bar, etc. in Illustrator. The downside of this is that it can be a bit time consuming. If I had the ability to change things in Ferret, one of them would be to output true postscript font text. One of the few points where I give NCAR Graphics credit is its ability to do this. All the code necessary to get any output is its downside. :-) Overall, Ferret wins hands down as my favorite graphics program because of its breadth of capabilities and ease of use.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Goran,
&gt; I will make a few comments, but I also hope that others in this list who have 
&gt; experience using Ferret to make plots for publication will add their suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; The metafiles can get big, as they are ASCII files with all of the commands
&gt; specifying graphics settings and each plot element as it is added to the plot. 
&gt; The postscript files generated with gksm2ps are also ASCII with a similar
&gt; amount of information.  If your plot has several overlays then all the information 
&gt; used to plot each layer is in these files.  A gif image is smaller, as it contains only
&gt; the color flag for each pixel in the final plot.  So it is not surprising that metafiles 
&gt; and postscript files are bigger than gif files, though I agree that 92 mb is big!
&gt; 
&gt; The batch postscript mode makes graphics calls to write postscript directly
&gt; from the GKS graphics software, so it does not contain the same postscript
&gt; commands, so the ideas in the FAQ, How can I control line thickness when 
&gt; I translate a metafile to a postscript file? do not apply to postscript generated
&gt; from the batch mode of Ferret. 
&gt; 
&gt; Did you try at the TR font in Ferret?  It is somewhat thicker and may have a better
&gt; appearance.  Also making the text bigger helps.  If these don't give you an acceptable 
&gt; output I wonder if a solution might be to create your final plot as a gif or postscript in 
&gt; batch mode but without the text, and then adding the labels using a separate graphics
&gt; program.  Does anyone have suggestions for tools Goran might use?

&gt; 	Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	According to instructions found in FAQ (How can I make publication-quality 
&gt; 	Polar Stereographic Plots? and other) I have produced some figures but I have 
&gt; 	some problems with outputing to postscript file.
&gt; 	I try to produce publication quality ps file on several different ways but 
&gt; 	none of them seem to be satisfying. I describe them and ask for your 
&gt; 	suggestion to complete the task: produce the publication quality plot!
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. I try to produce metafile since I am changing aspect ratio this is 
&gt; 	recommended method to produce the ps file. Featuring metafile is about 92 MB 
&gt; 	(!) and when I try to produce the ps file on the machine with low memory 
&gt; 	resources it chrasehs befor producing ps file completly. On the machine with 
&gt; 	1 GB memory it produces blured and patchy ps file about 72 MB in size.
&gt; 
&gt; 	(!) Additional note is that I do not use so extremly large data set and I 
&gt; 	really do not know why output file should be so huge. For producing a plot I 
&gt; 	have used about 5 files (topography, masks, and various data) with 352x160 
&gt; 	matrix size (only one vertical level) and with 22 time steps. I was also &gt; 
&gt; 	using geo_borders_intermed.nc file for puting coastlines and rievrs on the 
&gt; 	plot. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	2. I try to output the plot to the gif file. Featuring gif file is  94 KB in 
&gt; 	size and it looks ok, except numbers used by shade key and coordinate axis 
&gt; 	values. I try to change the font but this is the first time that I realized 
&gt; 	that all the fonts available in ferret does not look good. Even if you look 
&gt; 	at the picture available at the 
&gt; 	<a  href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/FAQ/custom_plots/polar_stereographic.html">http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/FAQ/custom_plots/polar_stereographic.html</a>    
&gt; 	you will see that for example C looks like eaten.
&gt; 
&gt; 	3. I try to aquire screenshoot with the gimp, but this is obviously pointless 
&gt; 	since output on the scree from ferret is not correct.
&gt; 
&gt; 	4. Finnaly I produced postscript in the batch mode (I have to quit changing 
&gt; 	the window size). It is 69 MB in size but fonts are not good as before. I try 
&gt; 	to change the ps file as decribed in FAQ (Changing line thickness in 
&gt; 	PostScript files) but greping the ps file it turns out that there is no line 
&gt; 	         3000 div setlinewidth
&gt; 	but
&gt; 	/w {setlinewidth} bind def  
&gt; 	and I do not know anything about postscript and what to do with that.
&gt; 	However converting with ps2pdf pdf file is about 13 MB and everything looks 
&gt; 	great (even numbers and not only on the screen but hard copy too). But for 
&gt; 	some reason I need to have postscript file. Trying to covert pdf with gimp to 
&gt; 	ps did not give the result.
&gt; 
&gt; 	My question is:How can I really produce publication quality plot with the 
&gt; 	ferret when all the fonts seem to have bad apearence even on the screen? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Additional question perhaps does not belong to this list but if someone could 
&gt; 	satisfy my curiosity I would be thankful:
&gt; 	I would also like to know why pdf file is smaller but of better quality than 
&gt; 	ps, or how is it posible at all to produce correct pdf file from bad ps file? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I am using ferret version 5.51, 5.53, and 5.6 on various Linux boxes (built 
&gt; 	with g77/gcc v2.96).
&gt; 
&gt; 	Thanks for your support,
&gt; 	Goran
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Ps: I do not really feel comfortable with the idea to switch to another 
&gt; 	visualisation tool...
&gt;
